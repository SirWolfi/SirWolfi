Hi I'm uh just a normal guy whos programming some stuff when motivated...

## My "Story"
So, the first time I got in touch with programming when I decided to learn `Lava`. <br>
I was very motivated and opend a tutorial series on youtube and... failed. Yet, i didn't even finished the instalation process! <br>
After several months I decided that I wan't to make a chat bot for discord in `python`. <br>
This time I got further and was confident. I learned for a few months and kind of forgot what my goal was. So in the end, I have never written a single line of the bot. <br>
But it teached me how things worked... kindof. I learned alone and had nobody to help me, so when I found things I didn't understand, I just ignored them instead of learning them. So in the end it took me two months to realise what functions are. <br>
I've nether written something bigger then a TikTakToe in python because some time after I found my new love: `C++` <br>
This seems odd because how could someone on earth who didn't even understand basic things learn such a hard language? <br>
The answer is quite simple. Python was to simple. C++ tought me the hard way how things work, so there was no way arround. <br>
Like functions, static types, structured programming, etc<br>
And to this day, I use C++ on a daily basis. I'm not good I guess but I'm very creative! <br>
<br>
Over the time I learned what object orientet programming, templates, polimorphism, inheritance, namespaces, etc means and how to use it. <br>
I'm very fascinated in `parsing` and `interpreting`, so C++ is maybe not the best fit, but It gets the job done and I really like it. <br>
Then I switched to linux (thank god) and I understood more and more what's going on on my computer. <br>
I also learned `bash` which I use mainly for little tools on my PC. <br>

## My Projects
_All these projects are on github_
### DigitalDiscord
---
This is probably the oldest of my projects. <br>
I planed to make something big, a commandline puzzle game. But I just kept adding things to the framework and had no idea how to start. <br>
So at the end I threw it after 6 months of working away. Yet it showed me something. <br>
I added an interpreter for a custom configurable scripting language to it (DDL) which showed me how cool parsing is! <br>

### Brainduck
---
Brainduck is an esoteric programming language inspired by brainfuck. <br>
I wanted to learn and use brainfuck and tried to implement it myself. And once I had the basics done, I just couldn't stop adding things. <br>
And in the end, Brainduck was born! <br>
It took me maybe two days or so to finish but it motivated me!

### ArgParser
---
This was a tool I had written for myself because I didn't want to use some else's work. <br>
And again, I added and added stuff and thought "Why not put it on Github just in case..." and here it is. <br>
Very simple, but effective!

### Taml
---
This is actually based of a work I did quickly after DigitalDiscord, yet I stoped working on it for some reason. <br>
Then a good time later I came back and "finished" it. I added the things I originally planed and more. <br>
It's a very simple markdown language to design your own Text adventures and ohnestly, I'm very proud about it. <br>
Back in the days of DigitalDiscord, I failed a lot. Nothing really worked and I was just not skilled enough to fix the bugs. <br>
But Taml, it just works! It functions as it is intended to do and that makes me very happy! <br>

## At the end
Once i begin to work on something, I mostly work until It's finished or in a state at whitch it's useable.
(Except DigitalDiscord) <br> <br>
I love to make frameworks and parser, but I'm actually quite bad at actually using them. <br>
The longest Brainduck programm is just a "Hello, World!" and the longest Taml adventure is 150 lines... <br>
I'm very creative at implementing things, but using it to work with it is hard. <br>
(Well, to be fair, what on earth would you want to programm with a brainfuck-clone and a Textadventure markdown language??) <br> <br>
I don't really like using some others code, so I avoid it as much as possible. <br>
I always try to implement things myself, even if they're in the end worse. <br>
(No, I don't use boost ;-;)

## Contacting me
Well, the best way, would be via discord I guess... <br>
