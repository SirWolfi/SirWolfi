Hi I'm uh just a normal guy programming some stuff when he is motivated...

## My "Story"
So, the first time I got in touch with programming when I decided to learn `Lava`. <br>
I was very motivated and opend a tutorial series on youtube and... failed. Yet, i didn't even finished the instalation process! <br>
After several months I decided that I wan't to make a chat bot for discord in `python`. <br>
This time I got further and was confident. I learned for a few months and kind of forgot what my goal was. So in the end, I have never written a single line of the bot. <br>
But it teached me how things worked... kindof. I learned alone and had nobody to help me, so when I found things I didn't understand, I just ignored them instead of learning them. So in the end it took me two months to realise what functions are. <br>
I've nether written something bigger then a TikTakToe in python because some time after I found my new love: `C++` <br>
This seems odd because how could someone on earth who didn't even understand basic things learn such a hard language? <br>
The answer is quite simple. Python was to simple. C++ tought me the hard way how things work, so there was no way arround. <br>
Like functions, static types, structured programming, etc<br>
And to this day, I use C++ on a daily basis. I'm not good I guess but I'm very creative! <br>
<br>
Over the time I learned what object orientet programming, templates, polimorphism, inheritance, namespaces, etc means and how to use it. <br>
I'm very fascinated in `parsing` and `interpreting`, so C++ is maybe not the best fit, but It gets the job done and I really like it. <br>
Then I switched to linux (thank god) and I understood more and more what's going on on my computer. <br>
I also learned `bash` which I use mainly for little tools on my PC. <br>
